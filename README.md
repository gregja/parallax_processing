Parallax processing in Vanilla JS (Canvas 2D)

This project is based on the tutorial :
  "The power of parallax processing", by Kris Hadlock (2012)
  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-parallaxprocessing/

I rewrote the JS code in Vanilla JS, including some of the best practices of 2019,
like the API Promise, the API Touch, the Path2D function, the strict mode, IIFE, etc.

I added an easing function of Robert Penner (which fires when you click on the jeep)
